### Email Body

Dear [Dr./Dra. Name],

I noticed your practice uses WhatsApp to communicate with patients — which is great. But I also know what that means: **endless back-and-forth messages, scheduling conflicts, and patients who can't reach you when they need to.**

I'm Adrian Gomez, and I've built something specifically for clinics like yours: **Servy**.

**What Servy Does:**
- Answers patient WhatsApp messages 24/7 (in Spanish, perfectly)
- Books, reschedules, and cancels appointments automatically
- Syncs directly with your Google Calendar — no double-booking
- Answers FAQ questions (services, pricing, location, hours)
- Sends automatic reminders before appointments (24h and 1h)
- All conversations stay organized in your dashboard

**The Result:** You get back 10-15 hours per week. Your patients get instant responses. Your practice runs smoother.

**We're Live Right Now:**
Servy is already serving clinics in Costa Rica. We're looking for 3-5 more practices to join us and help us refine the product.

**Here's the Ask:**
Free demo this week — 15 minutes max. I'll show you exactly how it works with your actual calendar and WhatsApp setup. No obligation, no pressure.

If you're even curious about what an AI assistant for your practice could look like, let's talk.

**Quick Link to Schedule:** [CALENDAR LINK GOES HERE]

Or just reply to this email with your availability.

Best regards,

## Version 2: Email (More Casual, Still Professional)

---

**Subject:** 15-minute demo? (AI for your WhatsApp)

---

Hi [Dr./Dra. Name],

Quick question: How much time per week do you spend responding to patient WhatsApp messages?

For most practices, it's **10-15 hours**. Time that could go to actual patient care.

I built **Servy** to fix that. It's an AI assistant that:
- Answers WhatsApp 24/7 in Spanish
- Books & reschedules appointments automatically
- Syncs with your Google Calendar
- Never misses a patient

We're currently onboarding a small group of clinics to refine the product, and I think [Clinic Name] would be a perfect fit.

Want to see it in action? 15-minute demo — totally free, no strings attached.

If you're interested, [CALENDAR LINK] or just reply with your best time.

Looking forward to helping you reclaim those 10+ hours.

Best,

**Adrian Gomez**

Hola [Dr./Dra. Name] 👋

Vi que atienden pacientes por WhatsApp. ¿Cuánto tiempo por semana les toma responder mensajes?

Creé **Servy** — un asistente de IA que responde por ustedes 24/7, agenda citas, y se sincroniza con Google Calendar.

## Deployment Strategy

### Email Addresses to Find:
1. **Google Search:** "[Clinic Name] + contact" or check their website
2. **LinkedIn:** Search doctors/clinic owners, message directly
3. **Facebook Pages:** Check contact info in clinic page "About" section
4. **Call the clinic:** Ask for "información de contacto para correos corporativos"

### Cadence:
1. **Day 1:** Send email
2. **Day 3:** Follow-up WhatsApp (if you have the number)
3. **Day 7:** Second email follow-up
4. **Goal:** 5 demos booked this week

### Tracking:
Create a sheet with:
- Clinic name
- Contact person
- Email
- WhatsApp
- Date contacted
- Status (sent / replied / demo scheduled / converted)

---

## Pro Tips

✅ **Personalize:** Use their name and clinic name (shows you did your homework)

✅ **Lead with pain:** Start with the problem (time wasted on WhatsApp), not the solution

✅ **Make it easy:** Provide calendar link for scheduling, not "let me know your availability"

✅ **Emphasize Spanish:** They'll appreciate that an AI actually speaks their language well

✅ **Social proof (when available):** "Already trusted by [X] clinics in Costa Rica"

❌ **Don't:** Use generic spam language or oversell features

❌ **Don't:** Make it about you — make it about their time/pain

---

## Calendar Integration

When you deploy, create a Calendly or similar link:
- **URL:** calendly.com/adrian-servy (or your preference)
- **Duration:** 15 minutes
- **Time slots:** 2-3 per day (9 AM - 1 PM, 3 PM - 5 PM best for clinics)
- **Note:** "Let me show you how Servy works with your calendar"

---

## Subject Line A/B Testing

If you want to test open rates:

**Curiosity-driven:**
- "Your WhatsApp Could Be Your Biggest Opportunity Right Now"
- "10 hours/week back in your calendar"
- "Appointment automation for [clinic]"

**Problem-driven:**

- "Stop responding to WhatsApp during patient hours"

Pick one, send to first 5 leads, measure opens/clicks, iterate.
